# ChineseName

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `chinese_name` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:chinese_name, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Since we use `floki` with `html5ever` parser, the Rust compiler [installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is required.
